# Schema External Reviews
This is a small project I made for a YouTube tutorial regarding [Schema External Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=495&v=eCwBgcrV7GQ) on both [Schema products](https://schema.org/Product)and [Schema services](https://schema.org/Service). This is extremely useful for shops that don’t have their own reviews, also the HTML5 code used uses [blockquote and cite](http://html5doctor.com/cite-and-blockquote-reloaded/) which will help prevent your site being hammered by [Google’s Panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda) for duplicate content. It is expected that you know a little bit about [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [Schema](https://schema.org/) before following the video tutorial.
